# Dr.-Strange-AR-Magic-Filter
Developed a real-time augmented reality filter inspired by Doctor Strange using Python, OpenCV, and MediaPipe. The project detects hand landmarks and interprets gestures to dynamically trigger and control magical AR visual effects, demonstrating practical applications of computer vision and real-time gesture recognition.
